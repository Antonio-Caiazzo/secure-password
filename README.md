# secure-password
Sometimes finding a secure password is really hard! A common technique is to take a common word and make the following substitutions:  Replace all letters s with the character $ Replace all letters a with the @ character Replace all letters l with the number 1 Replace all letters and with the number 3 Replace all letters or with the number 0 Replace all the letters g with the number 6 Replace all spaces with the "_" character Furthermore, if the password does not reach 8 characters in length, a series of "#" symbols are added to the end of the password in order to reach the standard length of 8 characters.
